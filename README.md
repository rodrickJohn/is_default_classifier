# is_default_classifier
The work contains the main jupyter notebook file for a Logistic Regression classifier written in R programming language. 

There are also supplimentray notebooks in <more notebooks> folder where I have trained a Random Forest classifier on the same dataset (file_2.csv). 
Jenkspy was used to find breakpoints when creating groups for features that needed grouping. Its notebook is also atached.

Thank you.
